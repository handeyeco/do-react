Welcome!

This is a small project to get you playing with React.

By editing `Child.jsx` and `styles.css`, create a React component that showcases your personality and/or interests.

The Child component is given three props. You can use any combination of them or none at all! It's totally up to you.

Props:

* `color`: a string containing a hexidecimal color value
* `blink`: a boolean that flips between true and false on an interval
* `changeColor`: a function that, when called, changes the color value

Goals:

* Build something fun
* Show your coding style
* Highlight your personality
* Discuss the choices you made

Constraints:

* Edit only `src/components/Child.jsx` and `src/styles.css`
* Don't edit other files or install additional dependencies
* Don't create additional files
